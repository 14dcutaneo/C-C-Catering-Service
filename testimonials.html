They were lovely to my boys and our guests and made sure everyone was taken care of.&nbsp; Every one of our guests complimented your food. Several people asked about catering services for themselves and all of your brochures were taken.&nbsp; I received 3 phone calls the following day with more compliments.&nbsp; Everyone agreed the desserts were fabulous. The cannoli went first!&nbsp; The guest of honor, my 8 year old son, declared &quot;Mom, this is a rockin' party.&quot;&nbsp; That said it all!&nbsp; Thank you again for your excellent service, your assistance with all the details and the fabulous food.
